RNN-DBSCAN: A Density-Based Clustering Algorithm Using Reverse Nearest Neighbor Density Estimates.
A new density-based clustering algorithm, RNN-DBSCAN, is implemented which uses reverse nearest neighbor counts as an estimate of observation density. Clustering is performed using a DBSCAN-like approach based on knearest neighbor graph traversals through dense observations.
